# Next.js 404 Error: getStaticPaths/getStaticProps Data Mismatch

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications involving dynamic routes and data fetching.  When using `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`, ensuring consistency between the generated paths and fetched data is crucial. An inconsistency can lead to 404 errors or unexpected application behavior.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file showcases a scenario where the paths generated by `getStaticPaths` do not align with the data fetched in `getStaticProps`. This mismatch occurs due to a difference in how paths are constructed and data is accessed.  This results in missing data and, consequently, 404 errors for certain pages.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version. It synchronizes path generation in `getStaticPaths` with data fetching logic in `getStaticProps` to resolve the 404 errors.  The key improvement is the alignment of path parameter names and how data is accessed.  The solution ensures that the data for each generated path is always available.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Observe the 404 errors when accessing certain dynamic routes.

## How to See the Solution

1. Switch to the `bugSolution.js` file.
2. Run `npm run dev` again.
3. Verify that the 404 errors are resolved and that all dynamic routes function as expected.

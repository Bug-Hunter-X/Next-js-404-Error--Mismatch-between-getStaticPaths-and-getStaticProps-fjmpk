In Next.js, a subtle issue can arise when using `getStaticPaths` with dynamic routes and data fetching. If your `getStaticPaths` function returns paths that don't match the data fetched in `getStaticProps`, it can lead to 404 errors or unexpected behavior. This often happens when there's an inconsistency between how you generate paths and how you fetch the corresponding data, for example, if your paths include an extra parameter or use a different naming convention.
